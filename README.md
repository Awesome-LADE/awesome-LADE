Architecture Model
===

C4-PlantUML
---
[C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/RicardoNiepel/C4-PlantUML) combines the benefits of PlantUML and the C4 model for providing a simple way of describing and communicate software architectures 

Architecture Analysis
===

JArchitect (Java，Commercial)
---
cyclomatic complexity, treemaps for exploring different metrics (complexity, size of methods etc

Structure 101 (Java，Commercial)
---
package structure, dependency matrices, tangles, coupling / cohesion

JDepend (Java)
---
[JDepend](https://github.com/clarkware/jdepend) - A Java package dependency analyzer that generates design quality metrics.

JDepend Maven Plugin (Java)
---
[JDepend Maven Plugin](http://www.mojohaus.org/jdepend-maven-plugin/) - This plugin produces a nicely formatted metrics report based on your project.

Class Dependency Analyzer (Java)
---
[Class Dependency Analyzer](http://www.dependency-analyzer.org/) - The purpose of this tool is to analyze Java™ class files in order to learn more about the dependencies between those classes.

slizaa
---
[slizaa](http://www.slizaa.org/) A Free and Open Source Workbench for Software Dependency Analysis.

Go City (Go)
---
[Gocity](https://github.com/rodrigo-brito/gocity) is a Code City metaphor for visualizing Go source code in 3D

Toxicity
---
[Toxicity](https://github.com/softvis/toxicity-reloaded) a rewrite of the original Toxicity chart in Javascript using D3.js


Tequila
---
[Tequila](https://github.com/newlee/tequila) is a visualization tool to compare DDD Model with code

ArchUnit
---
[ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) can unit test your Java architecture

blast-radius
---
[blast-radius](https://github.com/28mm/blast-radius) is a Interactive visualization tool of Terraform dependency graphs using d3.js

Version Control System (VCS) Analysis
===

Gource
---
Software projects are displayed by [Gource](https://gource.io/) as an animated tree with the root directory of the project at its centre. Directories appear as branches with files as leaves. Developers can be seen working on the tree at the times they contributed to the project.

Code Maat
---
[Code Maat](https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat) is a command line tool to mine and analyze data from version-control systems

Linguist
---
[Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) is a library used on GitHub.com to detect blob languages, ignore binary or vendored files, suppress generated files in diffs, and generate language breakdown graphs.


Tracing
===

opentracing
---
[OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) is a tool for Vendor-neutral APIs and instrumentation for distributed tracing

Zipkin
---
[Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) is a distributed tracing system.

General Software Visualization Tools/Library
===

Plantuml
---
[PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) is a component that allows to quickly write UML diagrams

Graphviz
---
[Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/) is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
